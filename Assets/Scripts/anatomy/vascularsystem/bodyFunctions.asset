  - LIVER
  - PLEURA
  - STOMACH
  functions:
  - '<br>Metabolism: The liver plays a central role in the metabolism of carbohydrates,
    proteins, and fats. It converts glucose into glycogen, which can be stored in
    the liver and used as an energy source when needed.<br> <br>Detoxification: The
    liver plays a crucial role in detoxifying the body by breaking down and removing
    toxins, drugs, and metabolic waste products from the bloodstream.<br><br>Synthesis:
    The liver synthesizes many essential proteins, including blood-clotting factors
    and albumin, which helps to maintain blood pressure and transport molecules throughout
    the body. <br><br>Storage: The liver stores vitamins, minerals, and other essential
    nutrients, such as iron and copper.'
  - '<br>Protection: The pleura helps protect the lungs by creating a fluid-filled
    sac around them. This sac acts as a cushion, reducing friction and preventing
    the lungs from rubbing against the chest wall.<br><br>Lubrication: The pleural
    fluid that fills the pleural cavity acts as a lubricant, allowing the lungs to
    move smoothly as we breathe.<br><br>Breathing: The pleura is essential for breathing.
    When we inhale, the diaphragm contracts, and the chest cavity expands, causing
    the lungs to expand as well. The pleura keeps the lungs attached to the chest
    wall, allowing them to move as the chest expands.<br><br>Immune defense: The
    pleura contains lymphatic vessels that help remove waste products and protect
    against infection.'
  - '<br>Storage: The stomach can expand and contract to accommodate food as it is
    ingested. This allows it to store food until it is ready to be digested.<br><br>Mixing
    and churning: The stomach uses its muscles to mix and churn food with digestive
    juices such as hydrochloric acid and enzymes. This process breaks down food into
    smaller particles and prepares it for further digestion in the small intestine.
    <br><br>Secretion: The stomach secretes a number of substances that aid in digestion,
    including hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and mucus. Hydrochloric acid helps to break
    down proteins, while pepsin is an enzyme that digests proteins. Mucus helps to
    protect the stomach lining from the acidic environment.<br><br>Absorption: The
    stomach is not a major site of nutrient absorption, but some nutrients, such
    as alcohol and certain medications, can be absorbed through the stomach lining.'

  description:
  - The liver is a vital organ located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen,
    just below the diaphragm and to the right of the stomach. It is the largest glandular
    organ in the human body and performs many important functions that are essential
    to the body's overall health and well-being.  The liver has a unique structure
    that allows it to carry out its many functions. It is made up of thousands of
    small lobules, each of which contains liver cells called hepatocytes, as well
    as blood vessels, bile ducts, and other specialized cells.
  - 'The pleura is a thin, double-layered membrane that surrounds the lungs and lines
    the inside of the chest cavity. It consists of two layers:  Visceral pleura:
    This layer covers the lungs and is in direct contact with their surface. It is
    a thin, transparent layer of mesothelial cells that are tightly adhered to the
    lung tissue.  Parietal pleura: This layer lines the inside of the chest cavity
    and is separated from the visceral pleura by a small amount of pleural fluid.
    It is composed of two layers: the outer layer, which is attached to the chest
    wall, and the inner layer, which is in contact with the visceral pleura.'
  - The stomach is a muscular sac located in the upper abdomen, between the esophagus
    and the small intestine. It plays a vital role in the digestive system, as it
    receives food from the esophagus and mixes it with digestive juices to begin
    the process of breaking it down into nutrients that can be absorbed by the body.
  location:
  - 'The liver is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, just below
    the diaphragm and to the right of the stomach. It is the largest glandular organ
    in the human body and is divided into four lobes: the right lobe, left lobe,
    caudate lobe, and quadrate lobe.'
  - The pleura is a thin, double-layered membrane that surrounds the lungs and lines
    the inside of the chest cavity. It is located in the thoracic cavity, which is
    the part of the body that lies between the neck and the abdomen.
  - 'The stomach is located in the upper abdomen, between the esophagus and the small
    intestine. It is situated in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, just below
    the left ribcage. '
